# Sprint 3

## Sprint Goal:

The “Picks and Predictions”, and “The Radar” user stories should be completed. This includes the features of selecting winners for daily picks, selecting preseason winner picks, and selecting a playoff bracket. This sprint will also include accessing a filtered Zone page with those posted by users in a user’s radar, being able to add users to the radar, viewing the radar in the user’s profile and adding a search feature to find users to add to the Radar. The app should be demo-able by the end of the sprint, and all user stories mentioned should be implemented.
