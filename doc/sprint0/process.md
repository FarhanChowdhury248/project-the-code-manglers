# Organizing the Team

We collectively organized the team by first creating a discord server for us to message. Once the server was made, we collectively decided on times for team meetings based on team members’ availabilities.

During sprint0, meetings were used to discuss what app idea to decide, what technology stack/frameworks we would use, then assigning tasks based on the sprint requirements to complete tasks.

The deliverables for sprint0 included 9 documents. Since the product backlog was considered the most important component for the team to complete, and Victor had valuable experience during his coop working on a project, we left the backlog to him to complete in a separate document for the major user features/stories. Once completed, we reviewed the document to make sure it covered all the major features SPORTCRED was looking for and then inputted everything onto Jira.

The summary and done files were written up collectively as a team on a separate google file. The competition file was left for Farhan and Ian to work on, while Renzo completed personas, and process documents. These documents were reviewed and agreed on collectively as a team.

The UI mockup involved more work to be completed; therefore, Ian, Renzo, Farhan and Kevin worked to create mockup of pages and linking them together.

# Decision Making Process

Decisions were made collectively as a team. Topics that needed decisions were brought up by members of our team as an open-ending question to the entire team. Then, each of us pitched ideas based on past experiences, ease of completion, meeting the requirements, etc. Once an idea was pitched, we talked about it in detail until coming to a conclusion whether to include it or not. Everyone also had equal opportunities to share their ideas to the group to discuss.

# Defining Priority and Points of User Stories

We decided as a team to use the fibonacci series to estimate points of user stories (ie. 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13..). We decided that:

1 point user story:

- For bug fixes, filling in databases
- Estimate to take at least half a day to 2 days
- Easiest difficulty

2 & 3 point user stories:

- Small components in applications
- Involves tasks such as:
  - Task to complete the UI for a search field
  - Task to complete frontend communication with backend
  - Task to combine together
  - Then a task to test

5 & 8 point user stories:

- Not very common
- If a 5 or 8 user story: means it can be broken down to smaller subtasks
- Involves major tasks such as:
  - Very stacked page to create UI for with lots of components to it
  - Involves debugging and dealing with problems interacting with ui
- Very large feature

13 point user stories:

- Used to estimate an entire user story (entire feature)
- Should be rarely used since this means it can be broken down into smaller subtasks

Priority for the application includes:

- User System features - registering, login, basic profile, editing profile
- The Zone, Open Court features
- ACS Activities - Trivia, Picks and Predictions, Debate

# Meet in Person or Online?

Meetings were conducted online through a discord voice channel.

# Frequency of Meetings

There were a total of 3 meetings conducted for sprint0. They were conducted with all members in attendance; and days were chosen as a result of the deadlines to meet for sprint0.

# Lessons to take forward for next phase

One lesson to take forward for the next phase includes preparation from each team member. Since this sprint involved requirements gathering and planning, it was very essential for each team member to be deeply familiar with Sportcred’s idea on their application. As a result, each of us needed to be familiar with their pitches during tutorials to get a feel of what they wanted. Similarly, preparation was required when deciding on priority of user stories on Jira as a Jira tutorial was conducted earlier for us that we needed to watch.

Another lesson to take forward is to make sure every team member is on the same page in understanding the tasks needed to be done to complete the sprint. Each team member should not be confused as to what needs to get completed since the tasks for the sprint take a lot of collective work in order to be completed effectively. Therefore, to efficiently complete the required tasks, each team member must each take the effort to fully understand what is expected out of them for the project in order to complete tasks as efficiently as possible.
