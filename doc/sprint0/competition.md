## **What is SPORTCRED**

SPORTCRED is an iOS app that allows any registered user to do trivia, predict brackets, debate, and publish/comment and/share posts for sports’ related content. It also tracks a user’s ability with a carefully calculated ACS score which serves as the primary metric to determine their proficiency as a sports analyst.


## **The Competition**


### 
    Touch Stat Lite (iOS app)


    Description: A simple app that allows users to track players/actions in games and see summary stats update live as the game progresses of the players/actions. Users also have the ability to record players/actions and string them together for a video.


    Similarities & Differences: This is better for users looking for a simpler sports app, with a simpler set of features and a lower-level analysis. However, Touch Stat’s functionality of recording players/actions in a match goes beyond SPORTCRED’s current design.


### 
    Footy/GAA/Netball/Rugby/Hoops Tracker (iOS app)


    Description: 5 apps developed by the same developer. They all follow the same structure and features. The user is carried through 3 screens each of which allow them to narrow down their selection by the team, player, and action respectively. At any given screen, you get a detailed report of your selection. The report can be a summary, timeline, or an event type report and is chosen by the user.


    Similarities & Differences: The app provides a detailed summary of the player, but offers no functionality to help the user analyze or track their progress. The app focuses more attention to the information provided and gives detailed reports.


### 
    Pro Sports Daily


    Description: A web forum to discuss sports related news. It divides each post into different categories based on the sport. Users can post content and reply to the thread. Users can search for posts by keywords.


    Similarities & Differences: User profile and basic stats are attached to each post and reply, similar to how we will be associating a profile picture and ACS score to the replies in the social media.

### 
    Reddit (r/nbadiscussion)


    Description: An all purpose web/mobile forum with a specific page dedicated to NBA topics. Users can post, comment, and reply. Users can tag other users and pages.  The most useful feature is the ability to up/down vote posts, comments and replies which provides a way to sort and order them based on reception.


    Similarities & Differences: Reddit does an excellent job of managing popular posts with the up/down vote system. They offer a linear system for measuring credibility by tracking the number of up/down votes received and associating it with a linearly calculated “karma” score. SPORTCRED seeks to improve on this with a more carefully calibrated metric to assess the user’s proficiency.

### 
    Discuss the Game


    Description: A web forum exclusively for sports discussions. It offers an appealing UI and divides all content based on sport. Users can comment on, like, and save posts and follow other users.


    Similarities & Differences: Discuss the Game takes the social media aspect of SPORTCRED and applies it to all sports. However, they also lack a way to measure the skill of their users and fail to offer a fun way for users to test their knowledge, unlike SPORTCRED which uses its ACS scores and trivia matches

## **Why SPORTCRED?**

SPORTCRED is different from these products, which also serve to allow users to debate NBA topics, because SPORTCRED has an ACS score, which tracks the credibility of users [picks and predictions, trivia and games, analysis and debate, participation and history].

SPORTCRED is distinctly better than other platforms for analysts and fans with above-average understandings of the game. These users have opportunities to spread their knowledge, and have their egos stroked when rewarded with ACS points, to increase their overall ACS score.

The competitors didn’t focus on these users because they would have to implement ELO tracking systems, which would be costly and may deter users from actively participating. Users may be discouraged to find their scores have dropped. Reddit has a similar “karma” system; however, it is linear and simple, compared to the ACS score which is calculated on more factors.
