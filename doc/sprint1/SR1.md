# SR1

## Participants:



*   Ian
*   Renzo
*   Victor
*   Kevin
*   Farhan
*   Swarup - TA
*   Warren Ward - SportCred
*   Jacob - SportCred


## Unfinished Tasks:



*   Completed all tasks and user stories for the sprint


## New Practices to Use for Next Sprint:



*   Constantly working on tasks every day 
*   Messaging teammates immediately when we have concerns (ie. busy with school work, unsure of environment setup)
*   Group discord calls that involve just working together and can voice questions/concerns if we have any


## Harmful Practices to Stop Using: 



*   Leaving the complete environment setup last minute without receiving feedback/assistance
*   Leaving tasks to complete during the final week of sprint thinking we would just get them done all at once
*   Not communicating concerns we have in regards to the sprint to teammates
*   Not being familiar with _all_ technologies being used and leaving a teammate who is familiar with it to complete tasks related to these technologies


## Best/Worst Experience During Sprint 1:



*   Worst experience - hearing at 10pm on Monday, October 19th that the sprint demo was the following day during tutorial 
*   Best experience - staying up until 5am working to complete sprint tasks with the team the day before the demo
